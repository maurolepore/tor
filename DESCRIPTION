Description: Use readwith to read, with your favorite reading function, 
    multiple files -- all at once. Its main function inputs a reader function 
    and returns a modified version that maps each files to one element of 
    a list (provided the first argument of the reader function is a path to a
    file). Compared to other packages aimed to reading files, readwith is more
    simpler, more flexible, and has less dependencies.
