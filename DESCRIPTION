Description: __readw__ allows you to read multiple files at once with any 
    reading function. Its main function, `readw::read_with()`, inputs a reader
    function and returns a modified version that reads any number of files and
    stores them into a list (provided the first argument of the reader function
    is a path to a file). Compared to other packages aimed to reading files, 
    __readw__ is more simpler, more flexible, and has less dependencies.
